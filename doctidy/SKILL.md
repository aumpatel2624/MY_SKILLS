description: "Use this skill whenever the user wants to clean up, reorganize, or restructure their markdown documentation. Trigger on phrases like: run doctidy, tidy my docs, organize my docs, clean up the docs folder, restructure my documentation, fix my docs structure, reorganize documentation. This skill scans the codebase, understands its structure, and reorganizes markdown files into a clean, logical, non-redundant docs/ hierarchy with a generated README, merged duplicates, and archived dead files."

# doctidy

> Like `tidy` for HTML — but for your entire docs folder.
> Scans your codebase, understands it, and reorganizes your markdown into a clean, logical, non-redundant structure.

## When to Trigger
- "tidy my docs"
- "run doctidy"
- "organize my docs"
- "clean up the docs folder"
- "restructure my documentation"

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Scan the Codebase
```bash
# High-level project structure
find . -maxdepth 3 \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' \
  -not -path '*/dist/*' -not -path '*/.next/*' \
  -not -path '*/build/*' -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
  | sort

# Identify tech stack
cat package.json 2>/dev/null || cat pom.xml 2>/dev/null || \
cat build.gradle 2>/dev/null || cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null

# Read ALL existing docs
for f in $(find ./docs -name "*.md"); do
  echo "===== $f ====="; cat "$f"; echo ""
done
```

### Step 2 — Analyze & Plan

1. **Tech stack** — language, framework, deployment
2. **Project type** — API, web app, CLI, library, monorepo
3. **Each doc's purpose** — one-line summary per file
4. **Redundancies** — overlapping content across files
5. **Dead files** — temp, scratch, zero-value docs
6. **Gaps** — missing docs based on what the codebase actually does

### Step 3 — Target Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md
├── getting-started/
│   ├── installation.md
│   ├── environment.md
│   └── quickstart.md
├── architecture/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── tech-stack.md
│   ├── data-structures.md
│   ├── api-contract.md
│   └── diagrams.md
├── guides/
│   ├── development.md
│   ├── testing.md
│   ├── deployment.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── reference/
│   ├── api.md
│   ├── changelog.md
│   └── collections/
└── planning/
    └── archive/
```

### Step 4 — Reorganize

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| ✅ Move | Correct content, wrong location |
| ✅ Merge | Redundant files with overlapping content |
| ✅ Rename | Needs `lowercase-hyphenated.md` convention |
| 📦 Archive | Temp, scratch, duplicate → `docs/_archive/` |

Always use `git mv` to preserve history.

### Step 5 — Merge Redundant Content

Read both files, synthesize unique content, write one clean result. Never just concatenate — rewrite for clarity.

### Step 6 — Write docs/README.md

- One-paragraph project description inferred from codebase
- Full TOC with relative links
- Quick-start snippet

### Step 7 — Report

### Merged
### Archived
### Renamed & Moved
### Created

## Quality Rules

- No `ALL_CAPS` filenames → `lowercase-hyphenated.md`
- No temp/draft files in final structure
- Every file must add unique value
- Max depth: 2 levels (`docs/category/file.md`)
- Non-markdown files → `docs/reference/collections/`
- Always `git mv` inside git repos
- Never hard-delete — archive when uncertain

## Safety Rules

- Show dry-run before any destructive action
- Default: move to `docs/_archive/`, not `rm`
- Run `git status` after to confirm clean state
- Never touch files outside `docs/` unless asked
